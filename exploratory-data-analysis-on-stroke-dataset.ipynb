# Appendix

```{r}
# Import dataset
location <- '../input/stroke-prediction-dataset/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv'
data0 <- read.csv(location)
```

### Data Cleaning

```{r}
# View data classes
str(data0)

# View Summary Statistics for data
summary(data0)

# Duplicate Data
data1 <- data0

# View all distinct categorical variable
lapply(subset(data1, select = c(gender, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, bmi, smoking_status)), unique)
```

#### Part 1 - BMI
```{r}
# Convert BMI to numeric
data1$bmi <- as.numeric(data1$bmi)

# Replace N/A's in BMI column with mean
data1$bmi[is.na(data1$bmi)] <- mean(data1$bmi,na.rm=TRUE)

# View New Summary Statistics for data
summary(data1$bmi)
```

#### Part 2 - Gender
```{r}
# Count the unique variables in the gender column
table(data1$gender)

# As 'Female' has the majority counts, replace 'Other' to 'Female'
data1$gender <- ifelse(data1$gender == "Other", "Female", data1$gender)

# Count the unique variables in the revised gender column
table(data1$gender)
```

#### Part 3 - Smoking Status
```{r}
# Count the unique variables in the gender column
table(data1$smoking_status)

# Calculate the probability of formerly smoker, current smokers and non-smokers given that there's only this three categories in the smoking_status column
prob.FS <- 885 / (885 + 1892 + 789)
prob.NS <- 1892 / (885 + 1892 + 789)
prob.S <- 789 / (885 + 1892 + 789)

# Duplicate the data
data2 <- data1

# Replacing 'Unknown' in smoking_status by the other 3 variables according to their weightage
library(tidyverse)
data2$rand <- runif(nrow(data2))
data2 <- data2%>%mutate(Probability = ifelse(rand <= prob.FS, "formerly smoked", ifelse(rand <= (prob.FS+prob.NS), "never smoked", ifelse(rand <= 1, "smokes", "Check"))))
data2 <- data2%>%mutate(smoking.status = ifelse(smoking_status == "Unknown", Probability, smoking_status))
# View the new Smoking Status column's unique values and their counts
table(data2$smoking.status)
# Remove columns that are not needed
data2 <- subset(data2, select = -c(rand,Probability,smoking_status))
```
data2 is the final modified dataset which will be used for the EDA section below.

#### Part 4 - stroke
```{r}
# Subset Data into Yes and No (stroke)
Yes <- subset(data2, stroke == '1')
No <- subset(data2, stroke == '0')
```

### EDA 
#### Part 1 - Bar Charts
```{r}
library("ggplot2")
# Create stroke counts table
strokecounts <- as.data.frame(table(data2$stroke))

# As 'Female' has the majority counts, replace num to char 
strokecounts$Var1 <- ifelse(strokecounts$Var1 == 0, "No", 'Yes') 

# Bar Chart of Patients With and Without Strokes
ggplot(strokecounts, aes(x = Var1, y = Freq, fill = Var1)) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme(legend.position="none") +
        geom_text(aes(label = Freq), vjust = 0) +
        labs(title="Stroke Status of Patients",x ="Stroke", y = "Frequency") +
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The number of patients who have not had strokes is vastly greater than the number of patients who have.

```{r}
# Create hypertension counts table
hypercounts <- as.data.frame(table(data2$hypertension))
  
# Replace num to char
hypercounts$Var1 <- ifelse(hypercounts$Var1 == 0, "No", 'Yes')

# Bar Chart of Hypertension : No vs. Yes     
ggplot(hypercounts, aes(x = Var1, y = Freq, fill = Var1)) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme(legend.position="none") +
        geom_text(aes(label = Freq), vjust = 0) +
        labs(title="Hypertension Status of Patients",x ="Hypertension", y = "Frequency") +
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```

The number of patients without hypertension is vastly greater than the number of patients with hypertension, but the gap is slightly less than the gap seen for stroke victims.

```{r}
# Create heart disease counts table
heartcounts <- as.data.frame(table(data2$heart_disease))

# Bar Chart of Heart Disease : No vs. Yes     
ggplot(heartcounts, aes(x = Var1, y = Freq, fill = Var1)) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme(legend.position="none") +
        geom_text(aes(label = Freq), vjust = 0) +
        labs(title="Heart Disease Status of Patients",x ="Heart Disease", y = "Frequency") +
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The gap between patients with and without heart disease more closely resembles the gap between those with and without strokes.

```{r}
# Create gender counts table
gendercounts <- as.data.frame(table(data2$gender))
  
# Bar Chart of Gender   
ggplot(gendercounts, aes(x = Var1, y = Freq, fill = Var1)) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme(legend.position="none") +
        geom_text(aes(label = Freq), vjust = 0) +
        labs(title="Gender of Patients",x ="Heart Disease", y = "Frequency") +
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

There are more Female patients than Male. The one entry that was stated as Other was added to the Female section since majority are female patients.

```{r}
# Create work type counts table
workcounts <- as.data.frame(table(data2$work_type))
  
# Bar Chart of Patient Work Type   
ggplot(workcounts, aes(x = Var1, y = Freq, fill = Var1)) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme(legend.position="none") +
        geom_text(aes(label = Freq), vjust = 0) +
        labs(title="Patient Work Type",x ="Work Type", y = "Frequency") +
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

There are approximately even amounts of patients that are working government jobs, are self-employed, and are children. The majority of patients work for private companies, and a small number have never worked.

```{r}
# Create ever married counts table
marriedcounts <- as.data.frame(table(data2$ever_married))
  
# Bar Chart of Patients Who Have Been Married  
ggplot(marriedcounts, aes(x = Var1, y = Freq, fill = Var1)) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme(legend.position="none") +
        geom_text(aes(label = Freq), vjust = 0) +
        labs(title="Bar Chart of Patients Who Have Been Married",x ="Have the Patient been Married", y = "Frequency") +
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Roughly double the amount of patients have been married before than those who have not. 

```{r}
# Create residence type counts table
rescounts <- as.data.frame(table(data2$Residence_type))
  
# Bar Chart of Patients Who Have Been Married  
ggplot(rescounts, aes(x = Var1, y = Freq, fill = Var1)) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme(legend.position="none") +
        geom_text(aes(label = Freq), vjust = 0) +
        labs(title="Residence Type of the Patients",x ="Residence Type", y = "Frequency") +
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The patients are nearly evenly distributed between rural and urban residences

```{r}
# Create smoking status counts table
smokecounts <- as.data.frame(table(data2$smoking.status))
  
# Bar Chart of Patients Who Have Been Married  
ggplot(smokecounts, aes(x = Var1, y = Freq, fill = Var1)) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme(legend.position="none") +
        geom_text(aes(label = Freq), vjust = 0) +
        labs(title="Smoking Status of Patients",x ="Smoking Status", y = "Frequency") +
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The unknown data was randomly added to the three categories above based of the probability. Most patients have either never smoked. The data for formerly and currently smokers are similar.

#### Part 2 - Histograms

```{r}
# Histogram of Age with normal distribution overlay
histage <- hist(data2$age,xlim=c(0,100),
                main="Histogram of Age with Normal Distribution Overlay",
                xlab="Age",las=1)
xfit <- seq(min(data2$age),max(data2$age))
yfit <- dnorm(xfit,mean=mean(data2$age),sd=sd(data2$age))
yfit <- yfit*diff(histage$mids[1:2])*length(data2$age)
lines(xfit,yfit,col="red",lwd=2)
```

The ages of the patients in the study are close to a normal distribution, with mean of 43.23 from the summary() function. Based on the information from the summary() function earlier and the chart above, most patients are around their 40s.

```{r}
# Histogram of Average Glucose Level with normal distribution overlay
histglucose <- hist(data2$avg_glucose_level,xlim=c(0,300),
                main="Histogram of Avg. Glucose with Normal Distribution Overlay",
                xlab="Avg. Glucose",las=1)
xfit <- seq(min(data2$avg_glucose_level),max(data2$avg_glucose_level))
yfit <- dnorm(xfit,mean=mean(data2$avg_glucose_level),sd=sd(data2$avg_glucose_level))
yfit <- yfit*diff(histglucose$mids[1:2])*length(data2$avg_glucose_level)
lines(xfit,yfit,col="red",lwd=2)
```

The average glucose levels of the patients in the study are right skewed, with mean of 106.15 from the summary() function earlier.

```{r}
# Histogram of BMI with normal distribution overlay
histbmi <- hist(data2$bmi,xlim=c(0,100),
                main="Histogram of BMI with Normal Distribution Overlay",
                xlab="Body Mass Index",las=1)
xfit <- seq(min(data2$bmi),max(data2$bmi))
yfit <- dnorm(xfit,mean=mean(data2$bmi),sd=sd(data2$bmi))
yfit <- yfit*diff(histbmi$mids[1:2])*length(data2$bmi)
lines(xfit,yfit,col="red",lwd=2)
```

The data for patient Body Mass Index is right skewed, with a mean of 28.89 from the summary() function above after modification. All NAs were updated to mean in Data Cleaning Part 1 Section.

#### Part 3 - Boxplot

```{r}
# Box and Whisker Plot of Age
boxplot(data2$age,main="Boxplot of Patient Age",ylab="Age",las=1)
```

The boxplot shows no potential outliers in patient age.

```{r}
# Box and Whisker Plot of Average Glucose
boxplot(data2$avg_glucose_level,main="Boxplot of Patient Average Glucose Level",
        ylab="Avg. Glucose",las=1)
```

The boxplot shows many potential outliers on the high end of patient average glucose level.

```{r}
# Box and Whisker Plot of BMI
boxplot(data2$bmi,main="Boxplot of Patient Body Mass Index",ylab="BMI",las=1)
```

The boxplot shows many potential outliers on the high end of patient body mass index.

```{r}
# Box and Whisker Plot of Average Glucose in Patients With and Without Strokes
boxplot(Yes$avg_glucose_level,No$avg_glucose_level,
        main="Boxplot of Average Glucose by Stroke Status",
        ylab="Age",las=1,names=c("Stroke","No Stroke"))
```

The boxplot shows a relatively similar mean average glucose level in patients who suffered strokes and patients who have not, with lots of high outliers among non-stroke victims.

```{r}
# Box and Whisker Plot of Body Mass Index in Patients With and Without Strokes
boxplot(Yes$bmi,No$bmi,main="Boxplot of Body Mass Index by Stroke Status",
        ylab="BMI",las=1,names=c("Stroke","No Stroke"))
```

The boxplot shows a relatively similar mean Body Mass Index in patients who suffered strokes and patients who have not, with a few high outliers among stroke victims and many high outliers among non-stroke victims.

#### Part 4 - Violinplot

```{r}
# Create a temp table for violin plots
temp <- data2
# Replace num to char
temp$stroke <- ifelse(temp$stroke == 0, "No", 'Yes')

# Violin Plot of Age in Patients With and Without Strokes
ggplot(temp, aes(x=stroke, y=age, fill = stroke)) +
  geom_violin(trim=FALSE, fill='#A4A4A4', color="darkred")+
  geom_boxplot(width=0.1) + theme_minimal()

```

The violin plot shows a much higher mean age in patients who suffered strokes than in those who have not, with a pair of low outliers among stroke victims. The older the patient is, there is a higher likelihood to be diagnosed with stroke.

```{r}
# Replace num to char
temp$heart_disease <- ifelse(temp$heart_disease == 0, "No", 'Yes')

# Violin Plot of Age in Patients With and Without Heart Disease
ggplot(temp, aes(x=heart_disease, y=age, fill = heart_disease)) +
  geom_violin(trim=FALSE, fill='#A4A4A4', color="darkred")+
  geom_boxplot(width=0.1) + theme_minimal()
```

The violin plot shows a much higher mean age in patients who suffered heart disease than in those who have not, with a pair of low outliers among stroke victims. The older the patient is, there is a higher likelihood to be diagnosed with heart disease.

```{r}
# Replace num to char
temp$hypertension <- ifelse(temp$hypertension == 0, "No", 'Yes')
# Violin Plot of Age in Patients With and Without Hypertension
ggplot(temp, aes(x=hypertension, y=age, fill = hypertension)) +
  geom_violin(trim=FALSE, fill='#A4A4A4', color="darkred")+
  geom_boxplot(width=0.1) + theme_minimal()
```

The violin plot shows a much higher mean age in patients who suffered hypertension than in those who have not, with a pair of low outliers among stroke victims. The older the patient is, there is a higher likelihood to be diagnosed with hypertension.

#### Part 5 - Correlograms

#### Correlogram of the Numeric Variables

The chart below  shows the correlation of all numerical variables in the cleaned data. The values in the diagonal cells are the min and max values. As an example, the minimum bmi is 10.3 whereas the highest bmi is 97.6. From the correlogram and the correlation table, it shows that all numeric variables are positively correlated to the predictor variable [stroke]. Age has the highest correlation index to stroke. 

```{r}
library(corrgram)
# create a new data that excludes ID column from data2
cor_data <- subset(data2, select = -c(id))
summary(cor_data)
# Create the correlogram for numerical variables
corrgram(cor_data, order=NULL, panel=panel.shade, text.panel=panel.txt,
         diag.panel=panel.minmax, main="Correlogram") 
# View the 2 decimal point correlation values of numerical variables
round(cor(subset(cor_data, select=c(age,hypertension, heart_disease,avg_glucose_level, bmi, stroke))),2) 
```


#### Correlogram of the Numeric Variables and Categorical Variables
From the correlation matrix based on numerical variables, there are 4 driving factors to determine if a patient will be diagnosed with stroke. They are age, hypertension, heart_disease and avg_glucose_level.

The plot below includes both numerical and categorical variables. The the top 4 driving factors remains the same as above. Ever_married has the highest correlation with stroke among all the categorical variables.

```{r}
library(caret)
library(corrr)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)

# Convert the Categorical Variables to Numerical Variables
# The new dataset is named as onehot
dmy <- dummyVars(" ~ .", data = cor_data)
onehot <- data.frame(predict(dmy, newdata = cor_data))
# View the headers of the new dataset
names(onehot)

# Correlation Table
cor_onehot <- correlate(onehot)
# Extract correlation related to stroke
cor_onehot%>% focus(stroke)

# Plot the correlation between stroke and all others
cor_onehot %>%
  focus(stroke) %>%
  mutate(rowname = reorder(term, stroke)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(term, stroke)) +
    geom_col() + coord_flip() +
  theme_bw()
```

#### Part 6 - Bar Chart grouped by Age

```{r}
# Break the age into 17 age groups
data2$age <- cut(data2$age,
                         breaks = c(-Inf
                                    ,5 ,10 ,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60 ,65,70,75,80
                                    , Inf),
                        
                         labels = c("0-4"
                                    ,"5-9","10-14","15-19","20-24"
                                    ,"25-29","30-34","35-39","40-44"
                                    ,"45-49","50-54","55-59","60-64"
                                    ,"65-69","70-74","75-79","80-84"
                                    ),
                         right = FALSE)
```

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 20}
